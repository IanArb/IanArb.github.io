## Background

I'm from Dublin, Ireland. I previously played hurling since I was 10 years old for St Vincents GAA club. Even back then, hurling was not hugely popular in the capital as opposed to Gaelic football. This is where I learnt team ethics, hard work and of course, bravery!

This video below best demonstrates our beautiful game.

Fast forward a couple of years, I graduated from [National College of Ireland](https://www.ncirl.ie/) in Computer Science and started to work for [Travelport Digital](https://digital.travelport.com/) (previously known as Mobile Travel Technologies) as an Android developer. 

During my time at Travelport Digital, I had the opportunity to work as an intern on delivering the first native Etihad Airways Android app. This is when my Android journey began and brought valuable skills such as; customer facing communication, scrum methodology, microservices architecture and of course, developing features in Android.  

While I finished up my degree at NCI, I rejoined Travelport Digital with the opportunity to work on the white label airline app, Fusion. This was my first experience working in product. I delivered features for check-in, interactive seat maps, and mobile boarding passes. I was also one of the first developers to be part of the team that on-boarded the first Fusion customer, Fiji Airways.

After an amazing 2 and a half years at Travelport Digital, I got the opportunity to join CarTrawler to help them unlock their mobile strategy. This also provides another opportunity to explore another area in travel industry, car rental and mobility.
